"# lie_algebras"

This package was developed using SageMath kernel 7.3. This package depends on the sage package being available. This means that importing it into your own project requires that you are on a Mac or Linux machine (last I checked it wasn't available on Windows) and have SageMath installed. Alternatively, you can make a project on Cocalc.com. If you import this package in a Cocalc project, then you'll have to run your code using either a SageMath kernel (stable is recommended) or with the Python 2 (SageMath) kernel.
